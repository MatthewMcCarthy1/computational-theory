# Computational Theory Assessment

This repository contains my submission for the Computational Theory module assessment. It consists of a Jupyter Notebook (`problems.ipynb`) that explores the key components of the SHA-256 cryptographic hash algorithm, as defined in the [Secure Hash Standard (FIPS 180-4)](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/fips/nist.fips.180-4.pdf).

The notebook builds the **SHA-256 algorithm from scratch**, demonstrating an understanding of the underlying theory by implementing the bitwise operations, constants generation, message padding, and final hash computation.

## Repository Contents

- `problems.ipynb`: The main notebook containing the solutions to the 5 assessment problems.
- `common_10000_passwords.txt`: A dataset of common passwords used for the dictionary attack demonstration in Problem 5.
- `requirements.txt`: A list of Python packages required to run the code (only **NumPy** is needed).
- `.gitignore`: Specifies files to be ignored by Git.
- `.python-version`: The version of Python (**3.12.1**) used to ensure the reproducibility of the environment.
