    "This notebook explores the key components of the SHA-256 cryptographic hash algorithm as defined in the [Secure Hash Standard (FIPS 180-4)](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/fips/nist.fips.180-4.pdf). It systematically builds SHA-256 from its fundamental bitwise operations through the complete compression function.\n",
    "\n",
    "All implementations follow FIPS 180-4 specifications and include comprehensive testing with verification against official standards. **Rather than treating SHA-256 as a black box, this sequential approach reveals how simple mathematical operations combine to create complex cryptographic security properties.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview of Problems\n",
    "I begin by examining the seven core bitwise functions defined in the **Secure Hash Standard**. These functions introduce **non-linear mixing** in the compression function, which ensures that even a small change in the input produces a large, **unpredictable** change in the output, technically known as **the avalanche effect**. It is important to note that although we cover the Parity function, **it** is only used in SHA-1, which is currently being phased out due to **successful collision attacks**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, I **extract** the 64 round constants from the cube roots of prime numbers. This demonstrates the **\"nothing up my sleeve\"** principle, meaning these constants come from a transparent, publicly verifiable source rather than being secretly chosen. **This design choice ensures no hidden backdoors exist in the algorithm.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the constants are established, I implement **message padding**. Padding ensures messages fit the required 512-bit block size by appending a single '1' bit, zero padding, and a 64-bit length field **encoding the original message length**. This structured padding guarantees that the message is unambiguous and can be processed in fixed size blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the message padded, I process it **block by block**. Each 512-bit block is expanded into a 64-entry message schedule, and eight working variables (a–h) are initialized from the current hash state. Over 64 rounds, these variables are updated using the message schedule, round constants, and the core **functions** (Ch, Maj, Sigma0, Sigma1).\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, I explore password security through practical demonstration. Using SHA-256, I successfully recover three common passwords via dictionary attack, revealing why fast hash functions are inappropriate for password storage. This section demonstrates the critical importance of purpose built password hashing functions like Argon2id, scrypt, bcrypt that incorporate salting and intentional computational cost.\n",

A significant milestone was a `2015` practical attack on SHA‑1 referred to as `The SHAppening`, which showed that attacks requiring around `2^57` operations were feasible in practice. This and related work undermined confidence in SHA‑1 and paved the way for the `2017 SHAttered attack`, the first publicly demonstrated practical collision for the full SHA‑1 hash function.

So by using the fractional parts of irrational numbers such as the cube roots of primes, the constants are guaranteed to appear **statistically random** meaning that the sequence of bits derived from the fractional part of the cube roots passes tests designed to detect predictable patterns. These would then prevent any suspicion thta the constants were chosen to create a hidden weakness like a backdoor, and ensures that the hash function has strong confusion and diffusion. \n",

    "As explained  [here](https://www.movable-type.co.uk/scripts/sha256.html), a **hash** acts as a kind of digital fingerprint or signature for data. Unlike encryption, hashing is a **one-way** process. It cannot be reversed to recover the original input. No matter how large the input message is, the resulting hash value always has a **fixed size**. \n",
    "\n",
    "The `hash_compression(current, block)` function implements the **compression step** at the core of SHA-256. It takes the current 256-bit hash state (eight 32-bit words) and a 512-bit message block, then produces an updated 256-bit state. This allows SHA-256 to process messages of any length by chaining together fixed size blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function follows [FIPS 180-4 6.2.2](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.180-4.pdf) and relies on the components defined in the previous problems:\n",

The remaining 48 words are generated using a recurrence relation involving the sigma0 and sigma1 functions (from problem 1) to ensure every bit of the block influences multiple rounds.\n",

    "2. **Initialize working variables** – The current hash state (H0 through H7) is copied into eight working variables (a through h).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **64 rounds of compression** – This would be considered the core of the algorithm, where the working variables are updated 64 times. In each round, new temporary values (T1 and T2) are calculated using the non-linear functions (ch, maj, Sigma0, Sigma1), the round constants K (sha256_constants from problem 2), and the message schedule word Wt. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Feedforward** – The final values of the working variables (a through h) are added to the initial hash state (H0 through H7) to produce the next 256-bit hash value, whcih becomes the input for the next block's compression. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each block’s output becomes the next block’s input, creating a dependency chain that ensures the **avalanche effect**, a single bit change in the message completely alters the final digest.

    "**How to improve the hashing of passwords against dictionary attacks:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Salting:**\n",
    "\n",
    "According to [OWASP Guidelines](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Password_Storage_Cheat_Sheet.html#salting), a salt is a unique, random value generated by a [cryptographically secure function](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cryptographic_Storage_Cheat_Sheet.html) and added to each password before hashing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why salting matters:**\n",
    "- Ensures identical passwords produce different hashes\n",
    "- Prevents rainbow table attacks (precomputed hash databases)\n",
    "- Forces attackers to crack each password individually\n",
    "- Adds non-determinism to the hashing process\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "If the password is `farm1990M0O` and a random salt is `f1nd1ngn3m0`:\n",
    "- Without salt: `hash(\"farm1990M0O\")` -> always the same hash\n",
    "- With salt: `hash(\"f1nd1ngn3m0\" + \"farm1990M0O\")` -> unique hash\n",
    "\n",
    "The salt is stored alongside the hash in the database (it doesn't need to be secret, its randomness provides the security).\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Use Proper [Password Hashing Algorithms](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Password_Storage_Cheat_Sheet.html#password-hashing-algorithms):**\n",
    "\n",
    "SHA-256 is designed for speed and data integrity, not password storage. Instead, use:\n",
    "- [**Argon2**](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Password_Storage_Cheat_Sheet.html#argon2id) \n",
    "    - Winner of the 2015 Password Hashing Competition.\n",
    "    - Resists both side-channel attacks and GPU-based cracking.\n",
    "    - Configurable parameters: memory usage, number of iterations, and parallelism.\n",
    "    - Example: balances CPU and RAM usage for stronger protection.\n",
    "- [**scrypt**](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Password_Storage_Cheat_Sheet.html#scrypt)\n",
    "    - Memory-hard key derivation function.\n",
    "    - Slows down attackers using specialized hardware.\n",
    "    - Configurable parameters: CPU/memory cost, block size, and parallelism.\n",
    "- [**bcrypt**](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Password_Storage_Cheat_Sheet.html#bcrypt)\n",
    "    - Suitable for legacy systems if Argon2 or scrypt are not available.\n",
    "    - Configurable work factor determines how slow the hash is.\n",
    "    - Maximum password input length is 72 bytes for most implementations.\n",
    "- [**PBKDF2**](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Password_Storage_Cheat_Sheet.html#pbkdf2)\n",
    "    - NIST-recommended, widely supported, FIPS-140 validated.\n",
    "    - Uses HMAC internally (SHA-256 is common).\n",
    "    - Configurable iteration count acts as the work factor.\n",
    "\n",
    "These algorithms are intentionally slow, making brute force attacks impractical. For new applications, **Argon2id is recommended** as the modern standard.\n"
