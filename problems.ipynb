    "\n",
    "The Parity function is a linear bitwise operation used in certain rounds of the SHA-1 hash algorithm (specifically rounds 20-39 and 60-79). It takes three 32-bit words, which we can call `x`, `y`, and `z`, and combines them by applying the XOR operation to each corresponding bit. \n",

    "$$\n",
    "Parity(x, y, z) = x \\oplus y \\oplus z\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "XOR (exclusive OR) works like this: for each bit position, if the number of `1`s in that position across `x`, `y`, and `z` is **odd**, the result bit is `1`. If it is **even**, then the result bit is `0`. \n",
    "\n",
    "This function helps increase **diffusion** in the hash algorithm, meaning that small changes in input spread out and affect many bits in the output. This contributes to the security of SHA-1 by making it more resistant to certain types of cryptographic attacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, despite these design features, **SHA-1 is no longer considered secure due to successful collision attacks**. A significant milestone was `The SHAppening in 2015`, when researchers demonstrated a practical collision attack on SHA-1 using affordable computing resources. This breakthrough helped accelerate the widespread deprecation of SHA-1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, major organizations have phased out SHA-1 in favor of stronger algorithms like SHA-2 and SHA-3, which do not use the Parity function.\n",
