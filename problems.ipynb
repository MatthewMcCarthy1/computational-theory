    "The Parity function is a linear bitwise operation used in certain rounds of the SHA-1 hash algorithm (specifically rounds 20-39 and 60-79). It takes three 32-bit words, which we can call `x`, `y`, and `z`, and combines them by applying the XOR operation to each corresponding bit. \n",

    "\n",
    "This function helps increase **diffusion** in the hash algorithm, meaning that small changes in input spread out and affect many bits in the output. This contributes to the security of SHA-1 by making it more resistant to certain types of cryptographic attacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, despite these design features, **SHA-1 is no longer considered secure due to successful collision attacks**. A significant milestone was `The SHAppening in 2015`, when researchers demonstrated a practical collision attack on SHA-1 using affordable computing resources. This breakthrough helped accelerate the widespread deprecation of SHA-1.\n",
