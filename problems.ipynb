    "The Parity function is a linear bitwise operation used in certain rounds of the SHA-1 hash algorithm (specifically rounds 20-39 and 60-79). It takes three 32-bit words, which we can call `x`, `y`, and `z`, and combines them by applying the XOR operation to each corresponding bit. \n",

    "\n",
    "This function helps increase **diffusion** in the hash algorithm, meaning that small changes in input spread out and affect many bits in the output. This contributes to the security of SHA-1 by making it more resistant to certain types of cryptographic attacks.\n",

    "However, **SHA-1 is no longer considered secure** due to successful **collision attacks**. Beginning around 2011, major organizations started phasing it out. Today, SHA-1 is officially deprecated in favor of stronger and more secure algorithms like SHA-256 and SHA-3, neither of which use the Parity function."
